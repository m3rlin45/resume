# [Chris Dewan's Resume](http://resume.m3rlin.net)

This repository contains my Resume. The resume itself is the file [resume.json]. This repository is linked to an [azure website](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/websites/) which, upon a push to master, pull, spell check, build, and deploy the resume in both [html](http://resume.m3rlin.net) and [pdf](http://resume.m3rlin.net/resume.pdf) formats.

###Spell Checking
Spell Checking is implemented using the [spelling] node package, along with a user defined supplimental word list [dictionaryAdditions.json](https://github.com/m3rlin45/resume/blob/master/dictionaryAdditions.json).

###PDF Generation
PDFs are generated by way of LaTeX. There is a [latex template](https://github.com/m3rlin45/resume/blob/master/templates/resumeTemplate.tex) in the project, which is filled with the resume data, and then compiled into a pdf using pdflatex. the resume template is based one one from [latextemplates.com](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/medium-length-professional-cv) originally by [Trey Hunner](http://treyhunner.com/). It has been extensively reworked to make it match my data, but the original design remains.


###Website Generation
The resume website is derived from a template [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) by Start Bootstrap. It has been heavily reworked in terms of content, but the overall design aims to be largely consistent with the original.

###Continuous Integration
For CI, this repo is linked to the azure website that hosts it. Upon a push to the master branch, Github will do a post to the deployment URL that has been registered as a "webhook" for this repo. That signals Azure to pull over the new rev. Azure's build system (Kudu) then will check .deployment and find the deploy.cmd command in the build folder. This script does the following actions:
* Installs NPM Packages
* Installs Bower Packages
* Spell Checks the Resume
* Builds the LaTeX Source
* Installs MiKTeX Portable if necessary, and builds LaTeX source into a pdf
* builds the Html page
* builds the CSS stylesheet

Assuming success, Azure will then copy these outputs over and begin serving them.
###Other Credits
This project inspired by [Steven Edouard's resume](http://resume.stevenedouard.com/). It waas originally, like his, based on [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) but lacks in pdf generation and dissatisfaction with the html options it had pushed me to the current design. The JSON file still follows the schema.

The Scheme for installing MiKTeX portable at deploy time, the script for doing so, and the method for debugging that script are all credit to Scott Hanselman's brilliant explanation of using [Ruby Middleman on Azure](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/RunningTheRubyMiddlemanStaticSiteGeneratorOnMicrosoftAzure.aspx).
