# Chris Dewan's Resume
============

This repository contains my Resume. The resume itself is the file [resume.json]. This repository is linked to an [azure website](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/websites/) which, upon a push to master, pull, spell check, build, and deploy the resume in both [html](http://resume.m3rlin.net) and [pdf](http://resume.m3rlin.net/resume.pdf) formats.

###Concept
This project inspired by [Steven Edouard's resume](http://resume.stevenedouard.com/). It waas originally, like his, based on [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) but lacks in pdf generation and dissatisfaction with the html options it had pushed me to the current design. The JSON file still follows the schema.

###Spell Checking
Spell Checking is implemented using the [spelling] node package, along with a user defined supplimental word list [dictionaryAdditions.json](https://github.com/m3rlin45/resume/blob/master/dictionaryAdditions.json).

###PDF Generation
PDFs are generated by way of LaTeX. There is a [latex template](https://github.com/m3rlin45/resume/blob/master/templates/resumeTemplate.tex) in the project, which is filled with the resume data, and then compiled into a pdf using pdflatex. the resume template is based one one from [latextemplates.com](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/medium-length-professional-cv) originally by [Trey Hunner](http://treyhunner.com/). It has been extensively reworked to make it match my data, but the original design remains.


###Website Generation
The resume website is derived from a template [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) by Start Bootstrap. It has been heavily reworked in terms of content, but the overall design aims to be largely consistent with the original.
