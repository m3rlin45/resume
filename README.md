# [Chris Dewan's Resume](https://resume.m3rlin.net)

This repository contains my Resume. The resume itself is the file [resume.json]. When changes are pushed to GitHub, it triggers a GitHub Actions workflow, that will spell check the resume and then build it into both an html web page, and a printable pdf. When changes are merged into the master branch, the workflow will also push the new website onto GitHub Pages, where you can view both the [html](https://resume.m3rlin.net) and the [pdf](https://resume.m3rlin.net/resume.pdf).

**Isn't this excessive, overengineered, and a waste of time?**
Yeah... basically, but it was a good opportunity to get a basic handle on stuff I don't deal with in my normal work, like web development tools, Github Actions, etc. Also, **it was FUN!**

## Development

To Develop on this resume, you need to have Python, NodeJs, and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) installed first.

Then you can install all the dependencies with and build like:

```
$ # Install Dependencies
$ npm install
$ poetry install
$ sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra # needed to build pdf on ubuntu/debian
$ # Development Commands
$ poetry run pytest # spell check
$ npm run build-styles # build css
$ npm run build-html # build index.html
$ npm run build-latex # build resume.tex
$ npm run build-all # equivalent to the above 3 commands
$ pdflatex resume.tex # builds pdf from resume.tex
```

## How Does It Work?

### Spell Checking
Spell Checking is implemented as a [unit test](test/spell_check_test.py), which can be easily executed with `poetry run pytest`. It uses [pyspellchecker](https://github.com/barrust/pyspellchecker) along with some basic normalization and detection of emails, urls, and the like. It uses a user defined supplimental word list [dictionaryAdditions.json](dictionaryAdditions.json) for rare words.

### PDF Generation
PDFs are generated by way of LaTeX. There is a [latex template](templates/resumeTemplate.tex) in the project, which is filled with the resume data, and then compiled into a pdf using pdflatex. The resume template is based one one from [latextemplates.com](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/medium-length-professional-cv) originally by [Trey Hunner](http://treyhunner.com/). It has been extensively reworked to make it match my data, but the original design remains.


### Website Generation
The resume website is derived from a template [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) by Start Bootstrap. It has been heavily reworked in terms of content, but the overall design aims to be largely consistent with the original. Much like pdf generation, there is a [template](templates/indexTemplate.html) that is filled with data to produce the index.html file that will be published to GitHub Pages.

### Continuous Integration
The CI system is pretty overengineered, because I wanted to try out GitHub actions. It consists of a [workflow](.github/workflows/github-actions.yml) that will produce 4 jobs. One to run unit tests (spell check), 2 to build the HTML and PDF in parallel, and one to package them together and publish to GitHub Pages. *There is no advantage to this design over a straightline execution of all 4 tasks in a single job.* However, doing it this way gave me the chance to explore some of the more advanced features of GitHub Pages, which was a lot of fun.


## Credits
This project inspired by [Steven Edouard's resume](http://resume.stevenedouard.com/). It waas originally, like his, based on [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) but lacks in pdf generation and dissatisfaction with the html options it had pushed me to the current design. The JSON file no longer follows the schema.
