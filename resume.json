Prior to integration onto a spacecraft it undergoes a long intensive test in simulated environments and using a simulation of the spacecraft and ground station that control it. I was the product owner for the ground station and spacecraft simulators (ESTE), in both hardware and software. In this role I undertook a large number of upgrades and improvements, both driven by customer needs and changing program requirements.",
